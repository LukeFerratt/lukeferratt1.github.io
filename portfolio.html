    <h1> Minion Collecting Game</h1>
      <img src="image1.png">
	<p>This is our project that we made using turtle commands. The basics of the game is that you have a controlled character at the bottom of the screen that you can move left and right with your arrow keys. Our character at the bottom is a famous bodybuilder and he is attempting to collect the falling minions to save them from certain doom. We created the background rainbow by using striping commands and the fill commands and just swapping colors. Lastly, we have a timer and a scoreboard, each minion collected is worth 10 points and you have 30 seconds to collect as many minions as possible. When the 30 seconds runs out the program closes. </p>

    <h1>Duck Hunter Game (Project 2)</h1>
        <img src="PictureOfDuckHunt.PNG" height="300">
      <p>This is our second project that we made using turtle commands. The basics of the game is that you use a slingshot at the bottom of the screen to throw rocks at ducks that are flying above you. We incorporated many aspects like a leaderboard that you enter your name in at the end, a timer that has 120 seconds on it, and a scoreboard that tracks how many ducks you have hit with rocks leaving the slingshot. We used a basic background picture of a duck habitat with the bgpic command. </p>

	    <p>This is our fishing game that we made for our scratch project(Dylan, Mark, Luke). The objective of the game is to catch as many fish as possible in the time limit by using the arrow keys on the keyboard to move around the screen.</p>

	    <h1>Fish Tank Project 2.1.6</h1>
	    <img src="Fish.PNG">
	    <p>This is the Fish Tank Project that we made from the instructions on PLTW. We made sure to go step by step and check each segment of code that is causing issues. By going slowly and methodically we saw what the issues are. To fix the problems we ensured Magnesium is the highest value, this made it show too high. 
After Magnesium, we changed the alkalinity levels and made the value to be okay by testing it in order to change the alkalinity levels. The last thing was the temperature model because we had to ensure that it would be efficient and work. In order to fix the temperature model we made it so the average temperature so it would read high. </p>

	    <h1>Bug Camouflage from Predators</h1>
	    <img src="simulation.PNG">
	    <p>This is our simulation project where we did a simulation of bugs and their camouflage from predators. In different environments bugs will have different camouflage to hide them from predators giving them an advantage. If a bug doesn't have camouflage to hide them in their environment, they will die more which decreases their population because they are less fit to survive and be protected from the predators since they will stand out in their environment. </p>

	    <h1>Rover Phone Home 3.1.6 Project (Luke Ferratt, M. Paranjape, D. DeMatteo)</h1>
	    <img src="projectpic.PNG">
	    <img src="mountain.PNG">
	    <p>This is our project where we used data from a rover and turned it into graphs and numbers through descriptions. The rover's sensor capabilities includes: sound, light, temperature, and a gyroscope. It also includes an internal clock, and the environment of the alien planet has rocky mountains, desert plains, marsh lands, tropical islands, and inland forests. We separated the four data sets into their own columns. Making graphs for each data set. Unfortunately, we were led astray and after our analysis, we assumed that the answer was rocky mountains. We were incorrect in our assumption because the correct answer is actually inland forest. We thought it was rocky mountain because it said lower temperatures, intense light, low constant howl of the wind, and constant winds whose intensities vary while inland forest has little to no wind and a smooth constant temperatures. We simply misread the data.  </p>

	    <h1> 3.2.4 Project Making Meaning From Data </h1>
	    <img src="graph1.PNG">
	    <img src="graph2.PNG">
	    <img src="graph3.PNG">
	    <p>This is our project that is about making meaning from data. We looked at honey production in different states like: Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. We measured High Tier Honey Producers, Mid Tier Honey Producers, and Low Tier Honey Producers. For us, it was hard to organize the data to create visuals, and to validate that the data collection algorithm we used was correct. Processing the data and seeing visualizations helped us to gain insight into the state of bee colonies in the US. </p>
