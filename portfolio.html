    <h1> Minion Collecting Game</h1>
      <img src="image1.png">
	<p>This is our project that we made using turtle commands. The basics of the game is that you have a controlled character at the bottom of the screen that can you can move left and right with your arrow keys. Our character at the bottom is a famous bodybuilder and he is attempting to collect the falling minions to save them from certain doom. We created the background rainbow by using striping commands and the fill commands and just swapping colors. Lastly, we have a timer and a scoreboard, each minion collected is worth 10 points and you have 30 seconds to collect as many minions as possible. When the 30 seconds runs out the program closes. </p>
